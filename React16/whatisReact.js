//What is React?
//What? Why? How?
//
//React is a JavaScript Library for building User Interfaces"
//React uses 'components to for building User Interfaces.'
//
//React runs in the browser instead of the server.
//
//Components?
//Displays image of components on webpage: Header/ Sidebar/ Headline/ Article Content
//
//We can build each component individually instead of as a whole which is convenient for others to work on code and it allows for manageability.
//
//
//React uses Declarative, Component - Based, and Learn Once, Write Any-where.
//Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
//Component-Based allows you to build encapsulated components that manage thier own state, then compose them to make complex to UIs.
//Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
//Learn Once, Write Anywhere doesn't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, therefore allowing you to develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.  React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
